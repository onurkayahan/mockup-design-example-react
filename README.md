 
I picked one mockup from internet and started to design it in React for fun. I tried to convert every little part even fonts. 
 
 # `yarn install`
 
 # `yarn start`

- Converted the attached mockup (mockup.jpg) into HTML and CSS
- Markup is responsive through mobile, tablets and desktop views.
- Guestbook entries are being fetched from a list and displayed on the page when it loads
- Guestbook form is functional that when submitted, it will add entries to the guestbook without reloading the page. Guestbook is loaded from local storage.
